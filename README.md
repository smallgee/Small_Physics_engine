make sure you change the data type in the <precision.h> file if you wish to compile in double precision, 
just change the |typedef| float real to whatever works for you, the typedef real is used as the var for the math library<spMath.h>
so that changes propergate without having to find every variable in the math library and manually changing it, you can simply change it in
the <precision.h>
